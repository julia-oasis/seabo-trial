# seabo

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1. 

Seabo is Trove’s serendipitous image browser which contains images that are known to be open access, out of copyright, shareable and reusable. 

Simply browse for an image using our various links such as [options - decade, contributor, etc] or if you’re feeling daring, click on ‘take me away Julio’ for a random image. Or you can use the search box to find something more specific.  
When you’ve found an image you want to use, simply download it and you’re away. We’d really like it if you could include a link back to the record in Trove, which you can find when you [click on cite this/bookmark/etc].


## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
